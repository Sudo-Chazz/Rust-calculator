# Simple CLI calculator

Just a simple CLI calculator created while learning the programming language Rust

How to compile:
`Cargo build --release` from within the calculator folder

## How to use the calculator and its limitations:

* only 2 numbers can be passed into the calculator
* the supported operators are +, -, /, \*
  * the \* operator can optionally be passed as an 'x' instead to avoid the escape sequence required to use \*
